<!-- what is a DOM -->

- DOM is an interface (a collection of buttons, levers, readouts) that your code can use to manipulate the page. Dom is a global variable which is on the windoe object.

- With Dome, you can change almost everything, except the stylesheets, your stylesheets is kind of like a different DOM

- DOM is dynamiccly chaning

<!-- DOM Selectors -->

- textContent: you can't set textContent on a collection of elements, only used after one element

- querySelector v. querySelectorAll: 
- after a single element vs. a collection of elements
- querySelectorAll never give us a null, gine us empty list if cannot find it
